# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

Week zero was more on the sense of knowing what we are going to create in all the bootcamp, but more from a realistic way, meaning having a scenario where we are hired by a company to create X or Y application.

I created a AWS account from zero, and got to apply all the security best practices that were taught on the live session and that AWS itself recommend.

I also got the opportunity to create AWS budgets and billing alarms, so I can be aware of what's going on (cost related) on my AWS account, and take actions in case they are required.

I got the opportunity to learn about lucid charts, where I create the conceptual diagram and the logical diagram of what our application will be (most of the ideas came from the videos and the live session):
